# Parking Spot Labeling and Classification Tool

Using computer vision algorithms and image processing tools to identify and classify between empty or occupied parking spots in a parking lot

This was developed for my digital image processing class final project, the grade was a **10**/10

I developed with Python and OpenCv a tool so the user can label the spots in the parking lot, and then, a neural network (YOLOv8) will run and classify the spots into empty or occupied.
